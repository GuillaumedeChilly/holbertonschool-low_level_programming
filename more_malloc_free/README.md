# C - More malloc, free

This project covers:

- malloc_checked: allocate memory safely with exit on failure
- string_nconcat: concatenate two strings with a limit on bytes of s2
- _calloc: allocate zero-initialized memory for an array
- array_range: create an array of consecutive integers

Only malloc, free and exit from the standard library are allowed.
